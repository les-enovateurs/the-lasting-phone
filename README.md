# The Lasting Phone
### Overview

**The Lasting Phone** is an open-source animation project to raise awareness about the impact and longevity of smartphones. Participants compare the age of their devices in a fun and interactive way!

### Project Objective

The goal is to invite participants at an event to scan a QR code. The application reads metadata from each participant‚Äôs smartphone, identifies the brand and estimates the manufacturing date. Each device is then ranked against others to find out who owns the ‚Äúlasting phone‚Äù.

### How It Works

1. **Scan QR Code**  
   Participants scan a QR code associated with the event.
2. **Metadata Reading**  
   The app extracts smartphone metadata to identify the brand and estimate its manufacturing date.
3. **Compare & Leaderboard**  
   The manufacturing dates are compared and a leaderboard is created, showing the current oldest phone.
4. **Win Notification**
    - If a participant owns the oldest phone at the time of scanning, they are prompted to take a photo, which is displayed as the current champion.
    - The current champion is also asked to leave their email address to be contacted if they remain the final winner.
